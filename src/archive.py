#==========================================================================================
# Completed TODOs
#==========================================================================================

# Added specified player type proportions (population wide / or within groups if I am staying with group_size == 4 num_membership == 2)

#DID Add player types and improved decision rule(s) for shared endowment case 
# Started on. The current decison rule works. Want to improve it even more
# M-20 Improved on it even more. Added between-group comparison for SHARED endowment.

#DID Initialize contributions for SHARED endowment case with player types
# Completed

#DID Fix Simulate Game Function for Shared Endowment Case
# Completed

#DID Improve the way my csv file looks and make sure it works with the monte carlo simulation portion (I think I am only saving the final iterations data as it stands)
# Completed. It now saves data from all iterations of the Simulation. HOWEVER !!!

## Completed Switch from numpyarray for MOI ==> Pandas DF. to_csv, as well as naming the rows/columns will be of
# great importance for my capacity to use the data in the future 
# Did, but now I cannot open the CSV FILE PROPERLY
